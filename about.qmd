title: "About"

I am a Senior Research Software Engineer and joined the Advanced Research Computing department at the University of Birmingham, UK, in December 2021. I have a strong technical background, with over 8 years engaged in STEM research across the UK and France. My strength is in mathematics and numerical modelling, with experience using HPC to run cutting-edge simulations.

I am currently responsible for developing and operationalising a space weather forecasting model, which ingests up to 250GB of data per hour of live data streams from global navigation satellite systems and radar. My expertise in high-performance computing and data engineering enables the seamless integration of high-quality observational data with data assimilation modelling to produce high-fidelity forecasts of space weather in the Earth's ionosphere. I orchestrate this computationally intensive process by writing custom asynchronous task queues to distribute processes across computer clusters and combine the resulting outputs into a user-friendly web framework for analysis and visualisation, achieved using Celery, Django and Plotly. I also achieved 5x the performance of the data assimilation through code profiling and parallelising routines. This product is developed in collaboration with ESA and the UK Met Office.

I am also responsible for providing the research software support service of the EPSRC Tier 2 Baskerville supercomputer, a national facility in which I manage stakeholder relationships with The Alan Turing Institute, The Rosalind Franklin Institute, and Diamond Light Source (the UK’s national synchrotron). I regularly engage and support researchers with writing documentation, creating video tutorials, and designing and delivering training events to enhance accessibility to compute. For example, I have designed and delivered several data engineering and deep learning Jupyter notebook courses as a qualified NVIDIA DLI and Software Carpentries Instructor, and I maintain the Baskerville HPC GitHub repo.
