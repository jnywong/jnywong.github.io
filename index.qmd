# Dr Jenny Wong

## Senior Research Software Engineer

### Advanced Research Computing, University of Birmingham, UK

<br>

Hello! My name is Jenny and I am a Senior Research Software Engineer in the [Advanced Research Computing](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/it/teams/infrastructure/research/index.aspx) department at the University of Birmingham.

I collaborate with research teams across the university on coding projects and provide specialist software support.

I also engage with high performance computing (HPC) user communities to lower the barrier to access to supercomputing through delivering training and workshops, and I am a certified [NVIDIA University Ambassador](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/training/) and [Carpentries Instructor](https://carpentries.org/).

This website contains a [short bio](about.qmd) about me, as well as a collection of presentations and content related to my research projects and training  materials.
