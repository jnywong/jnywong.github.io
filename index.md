_Hellooo_! My name is Jenny and I am the Technical Content Developer at [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/), a US-based non-profit that provides a global network of interactive computing platforms for research and education communities. I primarily support folks with getting the most out of cloud-native workflows through documentation, training and community engagement. I am passionate about democratising access to large-scale, scientific cyberinfrastructure and love using my deep technical skills and my friendly communication skills to bridge together technology and people.

My current work is mainly focused on the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative-funded [Catalyst Project](https://czi-catalystproject.github.io/catalyst-project/), to provide research communities in Latin America and Africa with access to interactive computing in the cloud through [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub). As part of this effort, I develop community-centric training materials in collaboration with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [The Centre for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE)](https://www.cscce.org/), [Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI)](http://investinopen.org/), [MetaDocencia](http://metadocencia.org/), [Centro de Computaci√≥n de Alto Desempe√±o de la Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba (CCAD)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://ccad.unc.edu.ar/&ved=2ahUKEwi0ptCq0aSIAxWkT0EAHTPMEaQQFnoECDAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3MoIOKfOoQnvEuTOxAtRrM) and [Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org/).

My scientific background is in mathematics, with a special interest in geophysical fluid dynamics. I obtained a PhD in the subject with my thesis entitled "A slurry model of the F-layer in the Earth's core".

This website contains a [short bio](about.md) about me, as well as a collection of **talks** and content related to my open-source **projects**.
