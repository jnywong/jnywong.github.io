Hello! My name is Jenny and I am the Technical Content Developer at [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/), a US-based non-profit that builds and supports open source cloud infrastructure for research and education communities.

My work is mainly focused on the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative funded [Catalyst Project](https://czi-catalystproject.github.io/catalyst-project/), with the aim of providing research communities in Latin America and Africa with access to large-scale scientific infrastructure. As part of this effort, I will help develop community-based training materials for interactive cloud-native workflows in collaboration with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [The Centre for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE)](https://www.cscce.org/), [Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI)](http://investinopen.org/), [MetaDocencia](http://metadocencia.org/) and [Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org/).

My background is in mathematics, with a special interest in geophysical fluid dynamics. She obtained a PhD in the subject with her thesis titled "A slurry model of the F-layer in the Earth's core".

This website contains a [short bio](about.md) about me, as well as a collection of presentations and content related to my research projects and training materials.
