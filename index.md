_Hellooo_! My name is Jenny and I am a Product Manager at [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/), a US-based non-profit that provides a global network of interactive computing platforms for research and education communities. I primarily support folks with getting the most out of cloud-native workflows through documentation, training and community engagement. I am passionate about democratising access to large-scale, scientific cyberinfrastructure and love using my deep technical skills and my friendly communication skills to bridge together technology and people.

Some of the things I get up to include:

- Providing frontline and second-line support for communities, including triage, [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) administration, events management and collecting product insights to improve user experience.
- Front-end development of the [FRX challenges](https://github.com/2i2c-org/frx-challenges) open-source project using Django, and managing deployment for the HHMI CellMap Challenge with Kubernetes.
- Continuously updating the [2i2c Service Guide](https://docs.2i2c.org/) and developing the main [2i2c.org](https://2i2c.org/) Hugo website, as well as contributing documentation to upstream open-source projects.
- Leading community engagement and outreach activities, such as hackathons to upstream contributions to [MyST-MD](https://mystmd.org/), delivering training courses and speaking at conferences.
- Developing community-based training materials for cloud-native, interactive computing workflows as part of the [Catalyst Project](https://catalystproject.cloud/), a large and complex multi-stakeholder collaboration in service of communities in the Global South.
- Implementing localisation CI/CD workflows with [Jupyter Book](https://next.jupyterbook.org/) and Crowdin for the [Hub Champion Training](https://catalystproject.cloud/hub-champion-training/) and [NASA TOPST: ScienceCore](https://sciencecore.github.io/climaterisk/) curricula.
- Managing and executing a communications strategy, including writing blog posts, running social media campaigns and tracking engagement analytics.

My scientific background is in mathematics, with a special interest in geophysical fluid dynamics. I obtained a PhD in the subject with my thesis entitled ["A slurry model of the F-layer in the Earth's core"](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/23167/).

This website contains a [short bio](about.md) about me, as well as a collection of **talks** and content related to my open-source **projects**.
